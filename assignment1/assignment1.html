                <b>Tutankhamun</b>, commonly referred to as <b>King Tut</b>, was an <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Egyptian</a> pharaoh who was the
                last of his royal family to rule during the end of the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt">18th Dynasty</a> (ruled c. 1332 –
                1323 BC in the
                conventional chronology) during the New Kingdom of Egyptian history. His father is believed to be
                the pharaoh
                Akhenaten, identified as the mummy found in the tomb KV55. His mother is his father's sister,<sup
                    id="a"><a href="#a_notes">[a]</a></sup>
                identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as "The Younger Lady" who was found
                in KV35.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of his
                eventual successor, Ay, to whom he may have been related. He married his paternal half-sister
                Ankhesenamun. During their marriage they lost two daughters, one at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the
                other shortly after birth at full-term.<sup id="2"><a href="#2_cite">[2]</a></sup> His
                names—Tutankhaten and Tutankhamun—are
                thought to mean "Living image of Aten" and "Living image of Amun", with Aten replaced by Amun after
                Akhenaten's death. A small number of Egyptologists, including Battiscombe Gunn, believe the
                translation may be
                incorrect and closer to "The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing" or, as Professor Gerhard Fecht believes,
                reads as "One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten".<sup id="b"><a href="#b_notes">[b]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutankhamun restored the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_religion">Ancient
                    Egyptian religion</a> after its dissolution by his father, enriched and
                endowed the priestly orders of two important cults, and began restoring old monuments damaged during
                the previous Amarna period. He reburied his father's remains in the Valley of the Kings and
                relocated the capital from Akhetaten back to Thebes.<sup id="c"><a href="#c_notes">[c]</a></sup>
                Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a
                deformity of his
                left foot along with bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which were found in
                his
                tomb. He had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria">malaria</a>.</p>
            <p>The 1922 discovery by Howard Carter of Tutankhamun's nearly intact tomb, in excavations funded by Lord
                Carnarvon,<sup id="3"><a href="#3_cite">[3]</a></sup> received worldwide press coverage. With over
                5,000 artifacts, it sparked a
                renewed public interest in ancient Egypt, for which Tutankhamun's mask, now in the Egyptian Museum,
                remains a popular symbol. The deaths of a few involved in the discovery of Tutankhamun's mummy have
                been
                popularly attributed to the curse of the pharaohs. Some of his treasure has traveled worldwide with
                unprecedented response; the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities allowed tours beginning in 1961.
                He
                has, since the discovery of his intact tomb, been referred to colloquially as "King
                Tut".<sup id="4"><a href="#4_cite">[4]</a></sup>

            <p>Tutankhamun, whose original name was Tutankhaten or Tutankhuaten, was born during the reign of Akhenaten,
                during the
                late Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.<sup id="5"><a href="#5_cite">[5]</a></sup> Akhenaten's reign was
                characterized by a dramatic shift in ancient
                Egyptian
                religion, known as Atenism, and the relocation of the capital to the site of Amarna, which gave its name
                to the modern
                term for this era, the Amarna Period.<sup id="6"><a href="#6_cite">[6]</a></sup> Toward the end of the
                Amarna Period, two other pharaohs appear
                in the record
                who were apparently Akhenaten's co-regents: Neferneferuaten, a female ruler who may have been
                Akhenaten's wife Nefertiti
                or his daughter Meritaten; and Smenkhkare, whom some Egyptologists believe was the same person as
                Neferneferuaten but
                most regard as a distinct figure.<sup id="7"><a href="#7_cite">[7]</a></sup> It is uncertain whether
                Smenkhkare's reign outlasted Akhenaten's,
                whereas
                Neferneferuaten is now thought to have become co-regent shortly before Akhenaten's death and to have
                reigned for some
                time after it</p>
            <p>An inscription from Hermopolis refers to "Tutankhuaten" as a "king's son", and he is generally thought to
                have been the
                son of Akhenaten,<sup id="8"><a href="#8_cite">[8]</a></sup> although some suggest instead that
                Smenkhkare was his father.<sup id="9"><a href="#9_cite">[9]</a></sup> Inscriptions
                from Tutankhamun's
                reign treat him as a son of Akhenaten's father, Amenhotep III, but that is only possible if Akhenaten's
                17-year reign
                included a long co-regency with his father,<sup id="10"><a href="#10_cite">[10]</a></sup> a possibility
                that many Egyptologists once supported but
                is now being
                abandoned.<sup id="11"><a href="#11_cite">[11]</a></sup></p>
            <p>While some suggestions have been made that Tutankhamun's mother was Meketaten, the second daughter of
                Akhenaten and
                Nefertiti, based on a relief from the Royal Tomb at Amarna, this possibility has been deemed unlikely
                given that she
                was about 10 years old at the time of her death.<sup id="12"><a href="#12_cite">[12]</a></sup> Another
                interpretation of the relief names
                Nefertiti as his
                mother.<sup id="13"><a href="#13_cite">[13]</a></sup> Meritaten has also been put forward as his mother
                based on a re-examination of a box lid
                and coronation
                tunic found in his tomb.<sup id="14"><a href="#14_cite">[14]</a></sup> Tutankhamun was wet nursed by a
                woman named Maia, known from her tomb at
                Saqqara.<sup id="15"><a href="#15_cite">[15]</a></sup><sup id="16"><a href="#16_cite">[16]</a></sup></p>

                been split between Upper and Lower Egypt. The principal vizier for Upper Egypt was Usermontu. Another
                figure named
                Pentju was also vizier but it is unclear of which lands. It is not entirely known if Ay, Tutankhamun's
                successor,
                actually held this position. A gold foil fragment from KV58 seems to indicate, but not certainly, that
                Ay was referred
                to as a Priest of Maat along with an epithet of "vizier, doer of maat." The epithet does not fit the
                usual description
                used by the regular vizier but might indicate an informal title. It might be that Ay used the title of
                vizier in an
                unprecedented manner.</p>
            <p>An Egyptian priest named Manetho wrote a comprehensive history of ancient Egypt where he refers to a king
                named Orus,
                who ruled for 36 years and had a daughter named Acencheres who reigned twelve years and her brother
                Rathotis who ruled
                for only nine years.<sup id="20"><a href="#20_cite">[20]</a></sup><sup id="21"><a
                        href="#21_cite">[21]</a></sup> The Amarna rulers are central in the list but which name
                corresponds with
                which historic
                figure is not agreed upon by researchers. Orus and Acencheres have been identified with Horemheb and
                Akhenaten and
                Rathotis with Tutankhamun. The names are also associated with Smenkhkare, Amenhotep III, Ay and the
                others in differing
                order.</p>
            <p>Kings were venerated after their deaths through mortuary cults and associated temples. Tutankhamun was
                one of the few
                kings worshiped in this manner during his lifetime.<sup id="22"><a href="#22_cite">[22]</a></sup> A
                stela discovered at Karnak and dedicated to
                Amun-Ra and
                Tutankhamun indicates that the king could be appealed to in his deified state for forgiveness and to
                free the petitioner
                from an ailment caused by sin. Temples of his cult were built as far away as in Kawa and Faras in Nubia.
                The title of
                the sister of the Viceroy of Kush included a reference to the deified king, indicative of the
                universality of his cult.</p>
            <h4 id="end of Amarna period" ; class="remove_marg">End of Amarna period</h4>
            <p class="small_top_marg">Once crowned and after "taking counsel" with the god Amun, Tutankhamun made
                several endowments that enriched and added
                to the priestly numbers of the cults of Amun and Ptah. He commissioned new statues of the deities from
                the best metals
                and stone and had new processional barques made of the finest cedar from Lebanon and had them
                embellished with gold and
                silver. The priests and all of the attending dancers, singers and attendants had their positions
                restored and a decree
                of royal protection granted to insure their future stability.</p>
